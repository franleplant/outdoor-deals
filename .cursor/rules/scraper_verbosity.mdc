# Scraper Verbosity Rule

The outdoor deals scraper must always be super verbose with detailed logging.

## Requirements:
- Always include extensive console.log statements showing progress
- Show detailed information for each step: fetching URLs, parsing products, processing data
- Display progress counters (e.g., "Processing seed X/Y")
- Include emojis in log messages for better readability
- Show statistics at each major step (products found, pages crawled, etc.)
- Report both successes and failures with clear messaging
- Display sample results for debugging purposes
- Always show final summary with counts and file locations

## Never remove:
- Progress logging during crawling
- Product extraction statistics
- HTTP request/response logging
- Error reporting with specific details
- Final completion message with process.exit(0)

This ensures the scraper provides complete visibility into its operation for debugging and monitoring purposes.
